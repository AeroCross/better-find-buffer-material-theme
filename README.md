### Material Theme for BetterFindBuffer

A simple [Material](https://material.google.com/) theme for the awesome [BetterFindBuffer](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/BetterFindBuffer) — based on the fantastic work of Mattia Astorino in his Sublime Text 3 [Material Theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme).

If you don't use that theme, make sure you do. It's awesome.
